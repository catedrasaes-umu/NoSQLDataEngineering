        The Database Research Group is part of the Department of Computer Sciences at the University of Salzburg, Austria. Our research interests include data-centric applications in database and information systems with a particular focus on similarity search queries over large data collections, for example, approximate matching of strings and trees, efficient indexes for distance computations, and top-k queries. Other fields of research include load balancing algorithms for distributed frameworks like MapReduce and queries in geographic information systems. The research results are new algorithms with performance guarantees, which are implemented and evaluated on the motivating application.
